Plan:

----------------

1) Trend-seasonal decomposition and exponential smoothing models

	- Data and Tasks
	- Series Components
	- Naive Models
	- STL algorithm
	- Series Characteristics
	- ETS Model (Part I)
	- ETS Model (Part II)
	- Theta method
	
	
2) ARIMA processes
	
	- Stationary processes
	- MA Process
	- ARMA equation
	- ARMA process
	- ARIMA process
	- SARIMA process
	- Unit root tests: ADF test
	- Unit root tests: KPSS test
	
3) Forecasting
	
	- Forecasting without a model
	- More predictors!
	- Predictors and ARIM A
	- Model Quality
	- Model Comparison
	- Forecast comparison
	
4) Pre-processing data

	- Handling missing data
	- Anomaly detection
	- Structural break detection
	
	
	
	
Question
========

Select the characteristics of STL.

Answerlist
----------

* Seasonal component should not change over time 
* Errors should be uniformely distributed
* STL does not have an underlying model
*	STL can provide the confidence interval for the seasonal component
* STL can only provide the confidence interval for the predicted values

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------

*	False. No assumptions for DGP are required
* False. No assumptions for DGP are required		
* True. 
* False. STL is not a model
* False. STL is not a model

Question
========

Calculate conditional expected value $E[3 W_7 + 6 W_5 + e^{W_5} \mid W_5]$.

Answerlist
----------
* $9 W_5 + e^{W_5}$
* $6 W_5 + e^{W_5}$
* $3 W_7$
* $3 W_2$
* $3 W_2 + 6 W_5 + e^{W_5}$
* $e^{W_5}$

Solution
========

$E[W_6 \mid W_4]=E[(W_6-W_4)+(W_4-W_0) \mid W_4]=W_4$
