# Syllabus

Course Format: Online with pre-recorded lectures and live webinars.

Course duration: about 4 weeks. The course is divided into 4 topics, the actual duration can be a little more than 4 weeks
depending on the actual pace of the course completion.

The course focuses primarily on forecasting univariate time series using statistical models.
The course also briefly covers the tasks of constructing series features, detecting structural shifts and anomalies,
decomposition of a series into components.

Students are expected to be familiar with probability theory, mathematical statistics, and econometrics.
From econometrics, only knowledge of multiple regression is required.

In the recorded screencasts Jupyter Notebooks with R kernel are used, but a student familiar with python will not have any difficulty evaluating similar models in python using the sktime library.

After successful completion of the course, the student will be able to solve the practical problems described in the course program.

# Course Program

Week 1. Trend-seasonal decomposition and exponential smoothing models

	Tasks for time series. Series components and features. Naive models, STL algorithm, ETS model and theta method.
	
	
Week 2. ARIMA processes
	
	Stationary processes. MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA. Unit root tests: ADF test and KPSS test.
	
Week 3. Forecasting
	
	Forecasting without a model. Choosing predictors. Predictors and ARIMA model. Assessing model quality. Comparing models and forecasts.
	
Week 4. Pre-processing data

	Handling missing data. Anomaly detection. Structural break detection
	

# Grading Formula

Forms of control: 2 online tests (for a Week 1 and Weeks 2 & 3) and  final project.

The online test involves multiple choice questions or entering a numerical answer, for some of the tasks you will need to use programming using R (though you can solve them using any programming language or statistical package). Online tests are evaluated automatically.

Final project involves independent work of the student with real data. Final project is assessed by a person.

Final grade = 0.2 * Test 1 + 0.3 Test 2 + 0.5 Project 

Each component of the final grade is translated into a 10-point scale (rounded to a whole number of points), then the total is calculated, then rounded arithmetically. None of the components are blocking.
