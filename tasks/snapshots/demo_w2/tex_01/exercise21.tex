\begin{question}
Consider LakeHuron dataset.
Estimate ARMA(2,0) model for the LakeHuron series. Forecast 100 steps ahead and compare the width of prediction interval 100 steps ahead vs 1 step ahead. Give the absolute value of the difference of the widths as an answer.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv}{here}.
\end{question}
