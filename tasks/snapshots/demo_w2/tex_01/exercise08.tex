\begin{question}
Consider the following process \(y_t = 3t + y_{t-1}+u_t\), where \(u_t\) is a whte noise.
Which of the weakly stationarity conditions are violated.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Autocovariance function depends only on the difference between time indexes
  \item Constant mean
  \item None of the conditions are violated, the process is stationary
  \item Constant variance
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Check mean and covariance functions.
\end{solution}
