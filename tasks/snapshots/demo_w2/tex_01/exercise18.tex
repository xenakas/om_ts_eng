\begin{question}
At last, if you aren't satisfied with prediction quality you can modify the model.
What can be the reasonable suggestions for model modification?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item In ACF(11) and PACF(11) for residuals were significant, better use ARMA(0,12) instead of SARMA.
  \item Probably logarithm wasn't the optimal transformation, better use Box-Cox transformation with parameter other than 0.
  \item There is still seasonal correlation in the residuals, so you can consider other parameter for SARMA part.
  \item The process could have been trend-stationary, you can remove trend instead of applying first differencing
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Increasing number of estimated parameters from 3 to 13 is not a good idea
  \item It can work
  \item It can work
  \item It can work, but note, that trend here is non-linear
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
