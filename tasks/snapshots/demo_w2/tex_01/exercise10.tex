\begin{question}
Consider a process \(y_t = 4 + 0.8 y_{t-1} + u_t\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise with variance 3.

Find it's autocovariance function \(\gamma_k\). Give \(\gamma_0\) as an answer. Provide the answer with 3 decimal digits.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
You are need to find the variance of \(y_t\). Note, that the process is stationary, so its variance does not change over time.
\end{solution}
