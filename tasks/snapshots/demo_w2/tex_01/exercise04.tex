\begin{question}
Consider a process \(y_t = 4 + 0.8 y_{t-1} + u_t\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise with variance 3.

Find it's autocorrelation function \(\rho_k\). Give \(\rho_3\) as an answer.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
To find autocorrelation function consider MA(\(\infty\)) representation of an AR(1) process.
\end{solution}
