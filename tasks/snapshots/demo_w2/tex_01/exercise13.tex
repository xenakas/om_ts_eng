\begin{question}
Let's continue conducting a Box-Jenkins procedure for the differenced log(gas) time series.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv}{here}.

At last we should estimate the chosen SARMA(0,1){[}0,1{]} for the transformed and differenced gas series and analyse the model.

Which of the following are true?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Both MA and SMA coefficients are significant
  \item Residuals are uncorrelated (autocorrelation of 1st order)
  \item Residuals are seasonally uncorrelated
  \item The residual ACF and PACF are not significant
  \item Distribution of residuals is normal
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Check model summary
  \item To check if residual are correlated try Box.test(x) and Box.test(x, lag=12)
  \item To check if residual are correlated try Box.test(x) and Box.test(x, lag=12)
  \item ACF(11) and PACF(11) are sigificant
  \item To check normality you can use shapiro.test(x) and jarque.bera.test(x) funcions Also, you can use checkresiduals(model) function to analyse the residuals
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
