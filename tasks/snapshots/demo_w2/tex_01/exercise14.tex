\begin{question}
Consider a process \(y_t = 6 + u_t + 0.7 u_{t-1} - 0.1 u_{t-1}\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise with variance 2.

Check that the process is invertible. If the process is invertible give the sum of the lag polynomial roots as an answer, else give 0 as an answer.
Provide the answer with 3 decimal digits.
