\begin{question}
Which of the following is correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Initial conditions can determine stationarity of the process
  \item If the ARMA equation has common roots, than it's irreducible
  \item Stationarity of the process is determined by AR part and invertibility by MA part
  \item If the irreducible ARMA equations has lag polynomial roots which are smaller than one by its absolute value, there are no stationary solutions
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Check ARMA lectures.
\end{solution}
