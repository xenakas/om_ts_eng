\begin{question}
Let's conduct a Box-Jenkins procedure for gas time series to determine the specification of SARIMA model.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv}{here}.

Is the variance stable?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Yes, we can proceed with gas time series
  \item No, the logarithmic transformation should be applied
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The variance grows over time, a transformation is required.
\end{solution}
