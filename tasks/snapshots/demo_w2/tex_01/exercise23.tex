\begin{question}
Consider the process \(x_t = x_{t−1} + \frac{1}{4} Z_{t−1} + Z_{t}\), where \(Z_t\) is a white noise process.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item invertible and non-stationary
  \item invertible and stationary
  \item non-invertible and non-stationary
  \item non-invertible and stationary
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Invertible since roots of MA polynomial is outside unit circle.
Non-stationary, since root of AR polynomial is not outside unit circle.
\end{solution}
