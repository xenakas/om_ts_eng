\begin{question}
Let's continue conducting a Box-Jenkins procedure for log(gas) time series.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv}{here}.

Conduct a Dickey-Fuller unit root test without trend and constant to check whether after applying both first and seasonal differences the series become stationary.
If the process is stationary give DF statistic as an answer, else give 0 as an answer.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
You can use ur.df(x, type = `none') function.
