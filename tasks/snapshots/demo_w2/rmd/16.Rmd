## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
options(scipen=999)

mod <- Arima(diff(LakeHuron), order = c(2, 0, 0))
fore <- forecast(mod,100)
fore <- fore$upper-fore$lower
sol_round <- round(fore[100,2] - fore[1,2],2)


```

Question
========


Consider LakeHuron dataset. 
Estimate ARMA(2,0) model for the LakeHuron series.  Forecast 100 steps ahead and compare the width of prediction interval 100 steps ahead vs 1 step ahead.  Give the absolute value of the difference of the widths as an answer.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.


You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

You can use Arima(x, order = c(p, 0, 0)) function.
