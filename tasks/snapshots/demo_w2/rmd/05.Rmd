Question
========


Consider a process  $y_t  = 4 + 0.8 y_{t-1}  + u_t$, where $u_t$ is a white noise with variance 3.  

Find it's autocovariance function $\gamma_k$. Give $\gamma_4$ as an answer.



Solution
========

To find autocovariance function consider MA($\infty$) representation of an AR(1) process.
