```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
options(scipen=999)



mod <- Arima(log(gas), order = c(0,1,1), seasonal = c(0,1,1))

fore <- forecast(mod,24)


sol_round <- round(exp(fore$mean)[24],2)




```

Question
========



Final step of the Box Jenkins procedure would be forecasting using the chosen model and analysing the prediction quality.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Calculate forecast 2 years ahead for gas time series using the model selected on the previous steps.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.



Solution
========

Don't forget you have applied transformation and differencing to the initial time series.
