Question
========


Consider a process  $y_t  = 6  + u_t + 0.7 u_{t-1} - 0.1  u_{t-1}$, where $u_t$ is a white noise with variance 2.  

Check that  the process is invertible.  If the process is invertible give the sum of the lag polynomial roots as an answer, else give 0 as an answer.
Provide the answer with 3 decimal digits.





Solution
========

The process
