Question
========

Which of the following is correct?


Answerlist
----------

*  If the irreducible ARMA equations has lag polynomial roots which are smaller than one by its absolute value, there are no stationary solutions 
*  If the ARMA equation has common roots, than it's irreducible
*  Stationarity of the process is determined by AR part and invertibility by MA part
*  Initial conditions can determine stationarity of the process


Solution
========

Check ARMA lectures.
