Question
========


Consider a process  $y_t  = 4 + 0.8 y_{t-1}  + u_t$, where $u_t$ is a white noise with variance 3.  

Find it's autocovariance function $\gamma_k$. Give $\gamma_0$ as an answer. Provide the answer with 3 decimal digits.




Solution
========

You are need to find the variance of $y_t$. Note, that the process is stationary, so its variance does not change over time.
