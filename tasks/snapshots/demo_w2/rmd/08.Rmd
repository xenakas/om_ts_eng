```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
options(scipen=999)

mod <- Arima(diff(gas), order = c(0, 0, 12))

fore <- forecast(mod,20)


sol_round <- round(fore$mean[12],2)




```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. Estimate MA(12) model for the first differene of gas series.  Find point forecast 12 steps aheaad.  Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.


You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

You can use Arima(x, order = c(0, 0, q)) function.
