## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
library(dplyr)


df <- LakeHuron
df <- data.frame(df)

df <- mutate(df, cm = cummean(LakeHuron))
df <- mutate(df, lm2 = (lag(as.vector(df))+lag(as.vector(df),2))/2)

mod <- lm(df~., data = df)
mod <-summary(mod)


sol_round <- round(mod$r.squared,3)


```

Question
========

Consider LakeHuron dataset. You need to estimate a linear regression model with two regressors: sliding window for mean applied to 2 previous values and growing window for mean. Provide the R squared for the estimated model as an answer  with 3 decimal digits.


You can load the LakeHuron data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data("LakeHuron") or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/LakeHuron.csv).



Solution
========

You can use cummean() and lag() functions to create regressors.
