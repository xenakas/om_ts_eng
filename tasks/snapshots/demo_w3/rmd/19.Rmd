Question
========


Consider a process  $y_t  = 2  + u_t + 0.2 u_{t-1} - 0.2  u_{t-1}$, where $u_t$ is a white noise with variance 5.  

Check that  the process is invertible.  If the process is invertible give the sum of the characteristic polynomial roots as an answer, else give 0 as an answer.
Provide the answer with 3 decimal digits.



Solution
========

The process is invertible.
