## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)



f1 <- auto.arima(LakeHuron)
f2 <- ets(LakeHuron)


sol <- dm.test(residuals(f1),residuals(f2),h=1)



sol_round <- 0


```

Question
========

Consider LakeHuron dataset. You need to estimate an ARIMA and ETS model with automatically chosen parameters. Compare in-sample one-step forecasts using Diebold-Mariano test applied to model residuals. Provide the DM statistics if the forecasts are different  with 3 decimal digits, else give  0 as an answer.


You can load the LakeHuron data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data("LakeHuron") or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/LakeHuron.csv).



Solution
========

You can use dm.test(residuals(f1),residuals(f2),h=1) function.
