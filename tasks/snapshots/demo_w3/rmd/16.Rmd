## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)


df <- log(gas)

f1 <- auto.arima(head(df,470))
f2 <- ets(head(df,470))


df_ac <- rbind(accuracy(tail(df,6), predict(f1, 6)$pred),
accuracy(tail(df,6), predict(f2, 6)$mean))

sol_round <- round(df_ac[2,5],3)


```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. You need to estimate an ARIMA and ETS model with automatically chosen parameters. Compare out-of-sample forecasts 6 steps ahead using MAPE. Provide  MAPE for the best of the compared models with 3 decimal digits as an answer.


You can load the LakeHuron data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data("LakeHuron") or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/LakeHuron.csv).



Solution
========

You can use dm.test(residuals(f1),residuals(f2),h=1) function.
