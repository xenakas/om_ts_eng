Answerlist
----------

*  If the irreducible ARMA equations has lag polynomial roots for the AR part which equal to 1, there are no stationary solutions 
*  If the ARMA equation has common roots, than it's irreducible
*  If the irreducible ARMA equations has lag polynomial roots for the AR part which are greater than 1, there are no stationary solutions
