## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
library(dplyr)

df <- tail(log(gas),308)

df <- data_frame(df)

df <- mutate(df, t=sqrt(1:308))

mod <- lm(df~t, data = df)

sol_round <- round(predict(mod, data.frame(t=sqrt(308+10))),3)


```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. You need to estimate a linear regression model for the logarithm of gas series staring from 1970. Use square root of the trend as a regressor. Provide the forecast 10 steps ahead for the log(gas) rounded up to 3 decimal digits as an answer.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

You can use lm() and predict() functions.
