```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
library(forecast)

sol_round <- sum(abs(as.numeric(unlist(acf(LakeHuron, plot = FALSE))[1:20]))>0.196)-1

```

Question
========

Consider LakeHuron dataset. You need to calculate how many lags in ACF are significant. 


You can load the LakeHuron data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data("LakeHuron") or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/LakeHuron.csv).


Solution
========

Use acf(x, plot = FALSE) function.
