## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)

df <- stl(log(gas),s.window = 12, inner = 2, outer = 1)

s <- df$time.series[,1]
t <- df$time.series[,2]
r <- df$time.series[,3]

  
id_f <- var(s)/(var(s)+var(r))

pr_f <- 1-var(r)/var(s+r)





sol_round <- round(pr_f,4)


```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. You need to do STL with 2 inner and 1 outer loop for log(gas). Calculate the strength of seasonality using the ideal and practical formula. Choose the one that is bigger as an answer. Provide the answer rounded up to 4 decimal digits.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

Calculate strength of seasonality according to the formulas given in the lecture.
