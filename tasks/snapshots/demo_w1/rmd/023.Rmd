## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
options(scipen=999)

mod <- ets(gas,"ZNZ")




sol_round <- round(mod$initstate[1],2)




```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. Estimate ETS model without a trend and automatically selected error and seasonality specification.   Provide initial state for trend component as an answer. Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.


You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

You can use ets(x,"ZZZ") function.
