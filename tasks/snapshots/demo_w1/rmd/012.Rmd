Question
========

Which of the following statements are true?

Answerlist
----------

*  PACF(3) shows how $y_{t-3}$ influences $y_t$ on average. 
*  To calculate ACF(2) you can either evaluate a paired regression of $y_t$ on  $y_{t-2}$ or calculate the sample correlation between them.
*  PACF(12) for monthly data would show how the change in the value of the series one year ago would influence current value if all the other values between were being constant.
*  You can't cluster time series just by using ACF and PACF features.
