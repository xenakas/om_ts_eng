## DATA GENERATION
mu = 0 
ss = 0.01 
h = 100




sol_round <- round(sqrt(100),2)



```

Question
========

Consider an independent observations model with  $u_t \sim (0, `r ss`)$. Construct two 95%  prediction  interval for random walk model and independent observations model 100 steps ahead. How many times the width of the random walk PI  is bigger than of independent observations PI?


Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.

Solution
========

Check lecture "Naive models".
