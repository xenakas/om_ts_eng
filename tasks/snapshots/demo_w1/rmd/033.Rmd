```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
library(forecast)


df <- diff(diff(log(gas),12),1)
ci<- qnorm((1 + 0.95)/2)/sqrt(sum(!is.na(df)))

sol_round <- sum(abs(as.numeric(unlist(acf(df, plot = FALSE, lag.max = 20))[1:20]))>ci)-1
sol_round

```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. First, take logarithm, first difernece and seaasonal difference. Then calculate how many lags in ACF are significant. 


You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).




Solution
========

Use acf(x, plot = FALSE) function.
