\begin{question}
Consider gas dataset. You need to do STL with 2 inner and 1 outer loop for log(gas). Next check whether the variance of the first half of the seasonal component equals to the second using F-test. Provide the p-value rounded up to 2 decimal digits.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv}{here}.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
You can use var.test(x, y, alternative = ``two.sided'').
\end{solution}
