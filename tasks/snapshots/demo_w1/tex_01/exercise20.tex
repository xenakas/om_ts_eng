\begin{question}
Consider ETS(AAN) model with \(\ell_0 = 30, b0 = 1, \alpha=0.2,\beta=0.3,\sigma^2=16\). We know that \(y_1=32,y_2=35\).

Find smoothed values \(\ell_1,\ell_2\) and give their sum as an answer.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Check lecture ``Naive models''.
