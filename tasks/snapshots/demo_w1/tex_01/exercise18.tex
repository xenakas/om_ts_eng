  \item The bigger the window \(h\) the smoother the resulting curve
  \item You can predict using LOESS
  \item The higher the degree of the polynomial the smoother the resulting curve
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item False. You can use any kernel function
  \item True.
  \item True.
  \item False. It works other way around
\end{answerlist}
