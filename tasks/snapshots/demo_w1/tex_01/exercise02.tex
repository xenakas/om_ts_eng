\begin{question}
Which of the following statements are true?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item To calculate ACF(2) you can either evaluate a paired regression of \(y_t\) on \(y_{t-2}\) or calculate the sample correlation between them.
  \item You can't cluster time series just by using ACF and PACF features.
  \item PACF(12) for monthly data would show how the change in the value of the series one year ago would influence current value if all the other values between were being constant.
  \item PACF(3) shows how \(y_{t-3}\) influences \(y_t\) on average.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item True.
  \item False. You can!
  \item True.
  \item False. This is ACF(3)
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
