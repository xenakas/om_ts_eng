\begin{question}
Select the characteristics of STL.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Trend in ETS model can't be negative
  \item If the seasonal oscillation amplitude is decreasing over time it's better to use ETS without seasonal component
  \item In long run in model with damped trend the trend disappears
  \item If the seasonal oscillation amplitude is increasing over time you can use Box-Cox transformation
\end{answerlist}
