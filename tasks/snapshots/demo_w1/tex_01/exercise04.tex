\begin{question}
Select the correct statements about STL.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item The algorithm contains two loops: outer and inner loop
  \item Increasing the number of iterations of the outer loop can help in case of severe outliers
  \item Within the inner loop the low-frequency component is extracted using LOESS applied to double moving average of the original time series
  \item The weights for the outer loop should be chosen by cross-validation
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item True.
  \item True.
  \item False. No it's applied to seasonal subcomponents \(C_t\)
  \item False. The weights are recalculated on each iteration of the algorithm depending on \(R_t\).
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
