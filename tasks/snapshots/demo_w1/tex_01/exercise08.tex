\begin{question}
Which of the following statements are true?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item You can improve forecast quality by averaging forecasts of a complex model and a naive one.
  \item There is no model to approximate dynamics of non-stationary time series.
  \item You can model stationary process using random walk model.
  \item A very complex model can perform worse than a naive independent observations model.
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item True.
  \item False. The stationary series models are similar to the independent observations model; non-stationary series models are similar to a random walk.
  \item False. The stationary series models are similar to the independent observations model; non-stationary series models are similar to a random walk.
  \item True.
\end{answerlist}
