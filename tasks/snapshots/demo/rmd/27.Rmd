Question
========

Consider ARDL model

$$y_t = c+  \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \ldots + \beta_p y_{t-p} + x_t + \alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \ldots + \alpha_q x_{t-q }  + u_t. $$

Which of the following statements about ARDL model  ARE correct? 

Answerlist
----------

*  ARDL model can be used if you want to find a long-term relationships between time series
*  ARDL model can model non-stationary $y_t$
*  $(u_t)\sim ARMA(p,q)$ w.r.t. white noise
*  ARDL model allows only one predictor for $y_t$
