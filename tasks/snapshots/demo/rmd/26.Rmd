Question
========

Suppose you want to predict future values of $y_t$. Which of the following statements ARE correct? 

Answerlist
----------

*  When working with monthly data adding $L^7y_t$ as a predictor can significantly  improve forecast quality
*  Random forest with linear trend used as a predictor will perform exactly the same if logarithm of trend would be used instead
*  In a regression without a constant term you can add 4 dummies for quarter of the year to model yearly seasonality 
*  To model yearly seasonality in daily data the only predictors required are   $\operatorname{cos}\left({\frac{4\pi}{365}}\cdot\,t\right)$ and $\operatorname{sin}\left({\frac{4\pi}{365}}\cdot\,t\right)$
