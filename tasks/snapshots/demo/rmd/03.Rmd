Answerlist
----------

*  In gradient boosting, if you suppose that the linear trend slows down over time you should use square root of trend instead of linear trend
*  If you suppose that the linear trend slows down over time you can apply Box-Cox transformation and use a linear trend as a regressor for the transformed data 
*  In a regression with a constant term you can add 7 dummies for each day of the week to model  weekly seasonality 
*  You can model yearly seasonality for daily data using fourier series

Solution
========

----------

*  False. Decision trees are invariant under monotonic transformations of time
*  False. Box-Cox transformation will be useful if the variance of the time series monotonically  changes over time
*  False. It's a trap!
*  True.
