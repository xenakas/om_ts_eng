\begin{question}
Consider a sample \(y^T = [4.22, 666, 4.09, 4.12, 1.72, 5.44]\). Say, you want to detect an outlier based on the residuals of a model on a constant \(y_t=c+u_t\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise. Give a new value for an outlier rounded to 2 decimal digits as an answer if there is one, else give 0 as an answer.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Check Anomaly detection algorithm from lecture ``Anomaly detection''.
