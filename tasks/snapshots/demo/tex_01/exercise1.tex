\begin{question}
Which of the following statements IS correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item The structural break can be detected by comparing heterogeneity of the the time series subsets with heterogeneity of the entire series
  \item Structural break detection algorithms should be applied to initial time series
  \item Usually it's enough to consider only one structural break
  \item There can only be one correct to identify the structural break
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item True.
  \item False. They can be applied to transformed data as well as to individual components
  \item False. This depends on data, multiple structural breaks can be as probable as single ones.
  \item False. Point of changes of the series behavior is subjective and depends on data and underlying model.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
