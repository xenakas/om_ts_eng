\begin{question}
Which of the following statements about Diebold-Mariano-test ARE correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item If model A has smaller RMSE than a naive model then model A should always be preferred
  \item Diebold-Mariano-test can be used to compare short and long-term forecasts
  \item Diebold-Mariano-test can be used to compare 3 or more forecasts to each other
  \item Diebold-Mariano-test is based on the idea of testing that the square loss by model A equals to the square loss by model B
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item False. The simpler the better, if by Diebold-Mariano-test the forecasts aren't different, probably a naive model can be preferred
  \item True.
  \item False. DM-test is not suitable for pairwise comparison of multiple forecasts
  \item True.
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
