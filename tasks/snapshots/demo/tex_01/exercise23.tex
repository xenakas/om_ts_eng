\begin{question}
Consider the process \(x_t = 0.5 x_{t−1} + 2 u_{t−1} + u_{t}\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise process.
\begin{answerlist}
  \item non-invertible and stationary
  \item invertible and stationary
  \item invertible and non-stationary
  \item non-invertible and non-stationary
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Non-invertible since root of MA polynomial is not outside unit circle.
Non-stationary, since root of AR polynomial is outside unit circle.
\end{solution}
