\begin{question}
Which of the following statements ARE true?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item If the irreducible ARMA equations has lag polynomial roots for the AR part which equal to 1, there are no stationary solutions
  \item \(y_t = 3 + 3t +u_t\) where \(u_t\) is a white noise is trend-stationary
  \item If the ARMA equation has common roots, than it's irreducible
  \item If the irreducible ARMA equations has lag polynomial roots for the AR part which are greater than 1, there are no stationary solutions
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Check lection about ARMA and ARIMA processes.
