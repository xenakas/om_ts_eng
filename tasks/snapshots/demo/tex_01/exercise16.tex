\begin{question}
Suppose you want to predict future values of \(y_t\). Which of the following statements ARE correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item In a regression without a constant term you can add 4 dummies for quarter of the year to model yearly seasonality
  \item When working with monthly data adding \(L^7y_t\) as a predictor can significantly improve forecast quality
  \item Random forest with linear trend used as a predictor will perform exactly the same if logarithm of trend would be used instead
  \item To model yearly seasonality in daily data the only predictors required are \(\operatorname{cos}\left({\frac{4\pi}{365}}\cdot\,t\right)\) and \(\operatorname{sin}\left({\frac{4\pi}{365}}\cdot\,t\right)\)
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Check lecture about Forecasting using predictors.
\end{solution}
