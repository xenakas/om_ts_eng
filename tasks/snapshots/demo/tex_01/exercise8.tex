\begin{question}
Consider tsAirgap dataset on monthly totals of international airline passengers with missing values filled in with linear interpolation.

Apply the log transform and then remove the linear trend. Check if there are any structural breaks using Binary Segmentation method. Give the number of structural breaks as an answer.

You can load the tsAirgap data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data(``tsAirgap'') after importing ``imputeTS'' library or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/SteffenMoritz/imputeTS/blob/master/data/tsAirgap.rda}{here}.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
You can use cpt.mean(ts, method = `BinSeg', Q = 1) function.
\end{solution}
