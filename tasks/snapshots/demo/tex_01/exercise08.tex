  \item You cannot make predictions for future values of \(y_t\) using linear regression model
  \item An example of growing window function is mean of 2 previous values
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item True.
  \item False. It depends on data
  \item False. You can!
