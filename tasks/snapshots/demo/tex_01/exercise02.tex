\begin{question}
Consider a process \(y_t = -1 + u_t + 0.8 u_{t-1} - 0.4 u_{t-2}\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise with variance 4.

Construct an 95\% prediction interval 2 steps ahead, given that \(\hat{u}_T=0.5, \hat{u}_{T-1}=-0.3\).\\
Provide the variance of the point forecast rounded to 3 decimal digits as the answer.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The variance of the point forecast will be equal to \(Var(y_{t+2}\mid \mathcal{F}_t) = Var(u_{t+2} + 0.8 u_{t+1} \mid \mathcal{F}_t)\)
\end{solution}
