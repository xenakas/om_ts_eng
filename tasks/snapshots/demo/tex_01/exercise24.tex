\begin{question}
Consider ARDL model

\[y_t = c+  \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \ldots + \beta_p y_{t-p} + x_t + \alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \ldots + \alpha_q x_{t-q }  + u_t. \]

Which of the following statements about ARDL model ARE correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item ARDL model can be used if you want to find a long-term relationships between time series
  \item ARDL model can model non-stationary \(y_t\)
  \item \((u_t)\sim ARMA(p,q)\) w.r.t. white noise
  \item ARDL model allows only one predictor for \(y_t\)
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item Check lecture about prediction with AR type models
  \item NA
  \item NA
  \item NA
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
