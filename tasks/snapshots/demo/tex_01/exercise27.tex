\begin{question}
Consider the following ARMA equation \(y_t= 2 - 0.4 y_{t-1} + 0.04 y_{t-2} + u_t + 0.5 u_{t-1}+ 0.06 u_{t-2}\), where \(u_t\) is a white noise with variance 1. Which of the following is true?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item The equation is irreducible
  \item The process is invertible
  \item The ARMA equation has infinite number of solutions
  \item The corresponding ARMA process is stationary
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
There is one common factor, hence in fact it is an ARMA(1,1). If you check the roots for this reduced process, it will be clear the process is stationary and invertible.
\end{solution}
