\begin{question}
Consider LakeHuron dataset. You need to estimate an ARIMA and ETS model with automatically chosen parameters. Compare in-sample one-step forecasts using Diebold-Mariano test applied to model residuals. Provide the DM statistics if the forecasts are different with 3 decimal digits, else give 0 as an answer.

You can load the LakeHuron data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data(``LakeHuron'') or if you use other programming languages you can download it \href{https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/LakeHuron.csv}{here}.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
You can use dm.test(residuals(f1),residuals(f2),h=1) function.
\end{solution}
