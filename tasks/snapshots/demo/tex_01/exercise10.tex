\begin{question}
Suppose you want to predict future values of \(y_t\). Which of the following statements is correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item In a regression with a constant term you can add 7 dummies for each day of the week to model weekly seasonality
  \item If you suppose that the linear trend slows down over time you can apply Box-Cox transformation and use a linear trend as a regressor for the transformed data
  \item You can model yearly seasonality for daily data using fourier series
  \item In gradient boosting, if you suppose that the linear trend slows down over time you should use square root of trend instead of linear trend
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item False. It's a trap!
  \item False. Box-Cox transformation will be useful if the variance of the time series monotonically changes over time
  \item True.
  \item False. Decision trees are invariant under monotonic transformations of time
\end{answerlist}
\end{solution}
