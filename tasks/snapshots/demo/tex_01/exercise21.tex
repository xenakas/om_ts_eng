\begin{question}
Which of the following statements ARE correct?
\begin{answerlist}
  \item ARMAX can work with non-stationary predictors
  \item In regression with ARMA errors you can use no more than two predictors
  \item In ARDL model lags of the predictors are used instead of noise lags \(u_t\)
  \item ARDL model can be used if you want to find a long-term relationships between time series
\end{answerlist}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
\begin{answerlist}
  \item False. In ARMAX regressors should be stationary
  \item False. You can use as many predictors as you like (unless you have enough data)
  \item True.
  \item True.

\end{solution}
