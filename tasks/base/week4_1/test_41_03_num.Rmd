```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
mu = 0.5 
ss = 2 

set.seed(324)

c <- round(rnorm(6, 0, 2)+3,2)

c[2] <- 666

mod<-summary(lm(c~1))
# sd(mod$residuals)*3

sol_round <- 0



```

Question
========


Consider a sample $y^T = [`r c`]$. Say, you want to detect an outlier based on the residuals of a model on a constant $y_t=c+u_t$, where $u_t$ is a white noise. Give a new value for an outlier rounded to 2 decimal digits as an answer if there is one, else give 0 as an answer. 

Solution
========

Check Anomaly detection algorithm from lecture "Anomaly detection".
