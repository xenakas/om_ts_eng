Question
========

Consider an independent observations model with  $u_t \sim (0, `r ss`)$. Construct a 95%  prediction  interval for independent observations model 100 steps ahead. Give the width of the interval as an answer. 

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.

Solution
========

Check lecture "Naive models".
