```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
library(forecast)

sol_round <- round(as.numeric(unlist(acf(LakeHuron, plot = FALSE)[6])[1]),4)



```

Question
========

Consider LakeHuron dataset. You need to calculate sample ACF(6). Provide the answer with 4 decimal digits.



You can load the LakeHuron data set in R by issuing the following command at the console data("LakeHuron") or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/datasets/LakeHuron.csv).


Solution
========

Use acf(x, plot = FALSE) function.
