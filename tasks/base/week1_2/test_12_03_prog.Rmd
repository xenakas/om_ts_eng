```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)


df <- stl(log(gas),s.window = 12, inner = 2, outer = 1)
df <- df$time.series[,1]
a <- df[1:238]
b <- df[239:476]

tt <- var.test(a, b, alternative = "two.sided")

sol_round <- round(tt$p.value,2)


```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. You need to do STL with 2 inner and 1 outer loop for log(gas). Next check whether the variance of the first half of the seasonal component equals to the second using F-test. Provide the p-value rounded up to 2 decimal digits.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

You can use var.test(x, y, alternative = "two.sided").
