Question
========

Select the correct statements about STL.

Answerlist
----------

*  Within the inner loop the low-frequency component is extracted using LOESS applied to double moving average of the original time series
*  The algorithm contains two loops: outer and inner loop
*  The weights for the outer loop should be chosen by cross-validation  
*  Increasing the number of iterations of the outer loop can help in case of severe outliers

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------

*  False. No it's applied to seasonal subcomponents $C_t$
*  True.
*  False. The weights are recalculated on each iteration of the algorithm depending on $R_t$. 
*  True.
