## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)




df <- stl(head(gas, 120),s.window = 12, inner = 2, outer = 1)
t <- df$time.series[,2]
r <- df$time.series[,3]
pr_f1 <- 1-var(r)/var(t+r)

df <- stl(tail(gas, 120),s.window = 12, inner = 2, outer = 1)
t <- df$time.series[,2]
r <- df$time.series[,3]
pr_f2 <- 1-var(r)/var(t+r)




sol_round <- round(pr_f1-pr_f2,4)


```

Question
========

Consider gas dataset. You need to do STL with 2 inner and 1 outer loop for log(gas). Calculate the strength of trend using the  practical formula for the first 12 years of observations and for the last 12 years. Give the absolute value of the difference between them as an answer. Provide the answer rounded up to 4 decimal digits.

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


Solution
========

Calculate strength of trend according to the formulas given in the lecture.
