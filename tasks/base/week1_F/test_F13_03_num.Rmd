Question
========

Consider ETS(AAdA) with $\alpha=0.2, \beta=0.1, \gamma=0.3, \phi=0.7, \sigma^2=1, l_T = 20, b_T = 2$, $s_{T} = 0.8, s_{T-1} = 0.7, s_{T-2} = 0.1, s_{T-3} = 0, s_{T-4} = -0.1, s_{T-5} = -0.7, s_{T-6} = -0.8$ and weekly seasonality.


Construct a 95%-interval forecast 2 steps ahead and calculate it's width. 
Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.







Solution
========

Check lectures ETS Model (I) and (II).
