```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
mu = 0.5 
ss = 2 


c <- round(cumsum(rnorm(4, 0, 2)),2)

sol_round <- round(qnorm(0.95)*var(diff(c))*2,2)



```

Question
========


Consider a random walk model. You have a sample $y^T = [`r c`]$ and you want to check if forecast 2 steps ahead would be non-positive at 5% significance level. Calculate right hand side of your confidence interval, corresponding to a required test. 

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.

Solution
========

Check lecture "Naive models".
