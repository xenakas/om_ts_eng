Question
========


Consider  ETS(AAN)  model with $\ell_0 = 30, b0 = 1, \alpha=0.2,\beta=0.3,\sigma^2=16$. We know that $y_1=32,y_2=35$.

Find smoothed values $\ell_1,\ell_2$ and give their sum as an answer.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.

Solution
========

Check lecture "Naive models".
