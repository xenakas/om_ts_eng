## DATA GENERATION


sol_round <- 90+0.9*10+0.1*1


```

Question
========


Consider  ETS(AAdN)  model with $\ell_0 = 90, b0 = 10, \phi=0.9, \alpha=0.1,\beta=0.2,\sigma^2=10$. We know that $y_1=100$.

Find smoothed value  $\ell_1$.

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.

Solution
========

Plug everything in a model and derive   $\ell_1$.
