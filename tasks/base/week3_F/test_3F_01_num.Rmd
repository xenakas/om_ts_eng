Question
========


Consider a process  $y_t  = 1 + 0.3 y_{t-1}  + u_t$, where $u_t$ is a white noise with variance 5.  

Find it's autocovariance function $\gamma_k$. Give $\gamma_5$ as an answer rounded to 3 decimal digits.



Solution
========

To find autocovariance function consider MA($\infty$) representation of an AR(1) process.
