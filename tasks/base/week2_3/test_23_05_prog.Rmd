```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION

library(forecast)
options(scipen=999)

```

Question
========

Let's conduct a Box-Jenkins procedure for gas time series to determine the specification of SARIMA model. 

You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).



```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggtsdisplay(gas)

```

Is the variance stable?



Answerlist
----------
* Yes, we can proceed with gas time series
* No, the logarithmic transformation should be applied

Solution
========

The variance grows over time, a transformation is required.
