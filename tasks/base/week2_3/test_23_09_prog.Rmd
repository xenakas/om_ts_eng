Question
========

Let's continue conducting a Box-Jenkins procedure for the differenced log(gas) time series. 


You can load the gas dataset in R by importing forecast library or if you use other programming languages you can download it [here](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/forecast/gas.csv).


At last we should estimate  the chosen SARMA(0,1)[0,1] for the transformed and differenced gas series and analyse the model.



Which of the following are true?


Answerlist
----------
* Both MA and SMA coefficients are significant
* The residual ACF and PACF are not significant
* Distribution of residuals is normal
* Residuals are uncorrelated (autocorrelation of 1st order)
* Residuals are seasonally uncorrelated

Solution
========



Answerlist
----------

*  Check model summary
*  ACF(11) and PACF(11) are sigificant
*  To check normality you can use shapiro.test(x) and jarque.bera.test(x) funcions Also, you can use checkresiduals(model) function to analyse the residuals
*  To check if residual are correlated try Box.test(x) and Box.test(x, lag=12)
*  To check if residual are correlated try Box.test(x) and Box.test(x, lag=12)
