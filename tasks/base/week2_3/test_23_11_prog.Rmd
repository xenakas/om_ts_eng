Question
========


At last, if you aren't satisfied with prediction quality you can modify the model. 
What can be the reasonable suggestions for model modification?



Answerlist
----------
* There is still seasonal correlation in the residuals, so you can consider other parameter for SARMA part. 
* Probably logarithm wasn't the optimal transformation, better use Box-Cox transformation with parameter other than 0.  
* In ACF(11) and PACF(11) for residuals were significant, better use ARMA(0,12) instead of SARMA.
* The process could have been trend-stationary, you can remove trend instead of applying first differencing  


Solution

*  It can work
*  Increasing number of estimated parameters from 3 to 13 is not a good idea
